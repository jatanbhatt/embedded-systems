All labs are working with an ARM Cortex microcontroller (STM32L476Discovery), programmed in Embedded C.

Lab 1:  Required us to flash an onboard LED at a certain frequency.

Lab 2:  Required us to make a reflex testing machine where a user presses a button to start the 'game' and an LED
is to flash at a random time and it measures and returns the time interval between the LED turning on and pressing a button,
hence a reflex testing machine.

Lab 3: Required us to make a digital clock that allowed users to change year, month, date, hour, min, and seconds. Also is capable of as storing 2 most recent user pushbutton interrupt times as per the clock in the external EEPROM.

Lab 4: Required us to set PWM duty cycle for cooling fan based on differential between user setpoint and analog temperature sensor input.

Lab 5: Required us to make a controller for a stepper motor with the ability to change speed, direction, and step mode.
