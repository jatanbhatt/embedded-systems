# microcontroller-projects
#All labs are working with an ARM Cortex microcontroller, programming everything in Embedded C

#Lab 1:  Required us to flash an LED at a certain frequency

#Lab 2:  Required us to make a reflex testing machine where a user presses a button to start the 'game' and an LED
#is to flash at a randome time and it measures and returns the time interval between the LED turning on and pressing a button,
#hence a reflex testing machine

#Lab 3: Required us to make a clock that allowed users to change year, month, date, hour, min, and seconds as well as storing
#the last two times the clock was put in to 'settings' mode to set the time in the EEPROM
